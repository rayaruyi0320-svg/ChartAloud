# Event-driven Audio Guidance integration (not implemented)

This document describes the internal event adapter only. The product now also has a
separate, user-initiated global voice/text guide in `src/voiceAssistant.js`. That
guide does not automatically react to the events below.

`src/guidance.js` exports `createGuidanceAdapter({ cancelPlayback })`. Its current
`implemented` flag is `false`; `emit` and `cancel` are no-ops. It has no network,
script generation, SpeechSynthesis, timers, or automatic sound. There is no homepage
Space handler.

A future teammate can replace the adapter internals without changing the Explorer.
Do not connect guidance to `Playback.speak` implicitly: that method serves explicit
exact-value reading and user-requested assistant answers. Future automatic welcome messages and instructions belong
to the guidance implementation, not render functions.

## Events

`main.js` calls the adapter with a fresh small context object:

```js
{
  mode: 'creator' | 'user' | null,
  materialId: string | null,
  revision: number | null,
  selectedPointId: string | null, // point-<1-based original mapped index>
  playbackState: 'stopped' | 'loading' | 'playing' | 'paused' | 'speaking'
}
```

No source worksheet or full dataset is sent by these events. Draft previews have
no published material identity. Point IDs are stable within a material revision
and refer to its selected range in original mapped order.

| Event               | Timing                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `modeEntered`       | After the selected mode renders and its title receives focus.                                         |
| `materialOpened`    | After a validated snapshot becomes the current dataset, old playback stops, and title receives focus. |
| `overviewRequested` | After the learner explicitly presses Show overview; the visible overview receives focus.              |
| `pointSelected`     | On explicit point selection and sequence progress; UI updates without rebuilding the Explorer.        |
| `playbackChanged`   | When the central playback controller updates a short status.                                          |
| `errorOccurred`     | On playback errors, failed publication, or material import errors. Errors remain visible in English.  |
| `contextExited`     | When leaving an Explorer, opening/replacing a material, or returning home.                            |

`stopAll()` also calls `adapter.cancel()` on navigation, data changes, point changes,
and new playback. Future guidance should use generation tokens or equivalent
cancellation to discard stale async results. `adapter.stopPlayback()` cancels
music, oscillator notes, sequence timers, and exact-value speech before guidance
speaks. It calls the playback controller directly, avoiding recursive adapter
cancellation. Avoid starting speech in response to its own playback status events.

Guidance must be opt-in and initiated by a valid user gesture. Cancel it when a
context exits. Do not assume speech or Web Audio is available, do not detect screen
readers, and do not use long aria-live messages that duplicate generated speech.
A future homepage Space shortcut must exclude controls and editable regions,
modifiers and repeated keydown events; it is deliberately absent now.

## Read-only facts for future agents

`window.chartaloudContext.getCurrent()` returns a structured clone of the current
mode, current User material (or null), selected point with stable point ID, and
computed `{ hi, lo, count }`. Mutating the copy cannot change application state.
Only this explicit pull interface contains the active material; events do not
send it anywhere. Facts come from the same selected dataset that the Explorer and
playback consume. The guidance adapter does not call the separate AI sound advisor.
